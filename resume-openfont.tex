\section{Work Experience}

\runsubsection{Cypress.io}
\descript{| Data Scientist Intern }
\location{May'20 - Aug'20 | Atlanta, GA}
\vspace{\topsep} 
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed statistical models to predict the prices of assets and help portfolio managers on multi billion dollar portfolio construction
\item Built the caching infrastructure to store the real-time data for financial products to enhance the performance of the back-test engine for systematic strategies. This reduced the average running time of models from 1 hour to 10 minutes
\end{tightemize}


\subsection{Goldman Sachs}
\descript{Data Scientist, Associate, Fixed Income Desk, GSAM}
\location{Aug 2017 - July 2019 | Bangalore, India}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed statistical models to predict the prices of assets and help portfolio managers on multi billion dollar portfolio construction
\item Built the caching infrastructure to store the real-time data for financial products to enhance the performance of the back-test engine for systematic strategies. This reduced the average running time of models from 1 hour to 10 minutes
\end{tightemize}

\descript{Data Engineer, Data Platform}
\location{June 2014 - July 2017 | Bangalore, India}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed the different components of technological stack for firm's data lake
\item Designed the database layer (HDFS, Hive) to support big-data solutions, the compute layer comprising of Spark for transformation and the serving layer to fetch data with low latency (improved from a minute to sub-second)
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Detecting Duplicate Quora Questions}
\descript{}\location{}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a Natural Language Processing model to identify duplicate questions using an ensemble model of BERT, Attention based LSTMs, Siamese LSTMs
\item Achieved accuracy of 90\% in detecting similar questions and marking them as duplicate
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{SNOTRA - Book Recommendation Application}
\descript{}\location{}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a hybrid recommendation algorithm of content based and collaborative filtering for books with an accuracy of 86\%
