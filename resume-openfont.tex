\section{Work Experience}

\runsubsection{Cypress.io}
\descript{| Data Scientist Intern }
\location{May'20 - Aug'20 | Atlanta, GA}
\vspace{\topsep} 
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed the data science platform and built prediction models for the subscription of the new clients and the churn of the existing clients which lead to a 7\% increase in subscriptions MOM and reduced churn rate to 1\%.
\item Built the data science infrastructure to deploy models, implement version control in the data and run the jobs on the AWS cloud infrastructure
\item Designed the data science tools - A/B testing significance calculator, size calculator and reporting tools for the board members and management 
\end{tightemize}

\subsection{Goldman Sachs}
\descript{Data Scientist, Associate, Fixed Income Desk, GSAM}
\location{Aug 2017 - July 2019 | Bangalore, India}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed statistical models to predict the prices of assets and help portfolio managers on multi billion dollar portfolio construction
\item Built the caching infrastructure to store the real-time data for financial products to enhance the performance of the back-test engine for systematic strategies. This reduced the average running time of models from 1 hour to 10 minutes
\end{tightemize}

\descript{Data Engineer, Data Platform}
\location{June 2014 - July 2017 | Bangalore, India}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed the different components of technological stack for firm's data lake
\item Designed the database layer (HDFS, Hive) to support big-data solutions, the compute layer comprising of Spark for transformation and the serving layer to fetch data with low latency (improved from a minute to sub-second)

\section{Academic Projects and Research}

\runsubsection{Detecting Fake Reviews and Question Answering}
\descript{}\location{}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a ensemble classifier to detect fake reviews on Yelp by using models like CNN, Gradient Boosting, BERT to classify the reviews with 88\% accuracy.
\item Developed a question-answering framework for user queries using BERT model trained with SQuaD and the set of classified genuine reviews 
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Detecting Duplicate Quora Questions}
\descript{}\location{}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a Natural Language Processing model to identify similar questions using an XGBoost and AdaBoost ensemble model of BERT, Attention based LSTMs, Siamese LSTMs and achieved an accuracy of 91\%
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{SNOTRA - Book Recommendation Application}
\descript{}\location{}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a hybrid recommendation engine using content based and collaborative filtering for books with an accuracy of 86\%
\item Used cosine similarity and KNN normalized ratings for the  user-to-user collaborative and content based filtering on the books using TF-IDF approach
\item Built an interactive web application using Flask and  D3/javascript to display force layout graphs between similar users and books
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep


\runsubsection{Mortality Rate in United States}
\descript{}\location{}
\begin{tightemize}
